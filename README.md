### About Me 👋

I am a software developer with a strong background in managing intricate business software projects. My expertise lies in Fullstack development, where I possess extensive knowledge of multiple programming languages, notably excelling in Typescript, JavaScript, and AWS technologies. 

My proficiency extends to diverse frameworks, including Angular, Node.js, React.js, and Next js. 

I have hands-on experience with both SQL databases, such as MySQL and Oracle, and NoSQL databases, particularly MongoDB and DynamoDB. This comprehensive skill set enables me to navigate complex software development projects with confidence and expertise.
